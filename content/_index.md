Welcome to the home page of this new wiki based on the HUGO static page generator, and enjoy the new style of a brand new wiki!

## Contributing

---

If you would like to contribute to this project you are always free to do so, you can either press the _**edit this page**_ button at the bottom of any existing page or you can just follow [this](https://github.com/Capybaric123/Danny-s-Wiki/tree/main) link and create your own page instead of editing one.

---

After you are done working on your own, or editing someone else's page, you can make a pull request and I will review the page and if it is appropriate I will of course accept the pull request and your new page will be on the website!
